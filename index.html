        OpenMBEE is an open source community built around a Model-Based Engineering Environment.
        The concept is to create an integrated environment for engineering that is driven around models and capabilities
        which support model-based approaches. Such environments inherently serve multiple modeling languages as well as
        a
        variety of techniques for model checking, simulation, document generation etc.
        OpenMBEE GitHub has a variety of open source projects supporting this pursuit as well as contributed open source
        models.
        The intent is that more open source models and model libraries will flourish as the community grows.
        Another distinctive quality is that the open source software on OpenMBEE includes plugins or extensions for
        commercial tools. This supports the idea to create a unified environment based on a variety of commodity
        software.
        Software is typically licensed under Apache 2. So it is free to use without strings.
        OpenMBEE has several major organizations on the leadership team. Anyone is welcome to join.
        There are regular meetings on line and face to face. We hold regular face to face meetings at the OMG and we
        meet regularly online.

        OpenMBEE software provides a platform for modeling that utilizes the Model Management System (MMS) that can be
        accessed
        from rich SysML desktop clients like MagicDraw, light-weight web-based client like View Editor, mathematical
        computation
        programs like Mathematica, and any other tool that can utilize RESTful web services. It provides infrastructure
        for
        versioning, workflow management, and access control. OpenMBEE software facilitates multi-tool and
        multi-repository integration across
        engineering, computing, and management disciplines. OpenMBEE software provides the core allowing tracking
        relations between
        heterogeneous data sources in a linked data architecture. System models are constructed, queried and rendered
        following
        the view and viewpoint paradigm.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk">Model Development Kit</a></h4>
        <p>MDK is a plugin for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nomagic.com/products/magicdraw">MagicDraw</a> that's
          primary purposes are to sync SysML models with the MMS and implement the DocGen language, which allows
          modelers to dynamically generate documents in a model-based approach using the view and viewpoint concept.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms">Model Management System</a></h4>
        <p>MMS is a version control system for structured data. It exposes model information through RESTful web
          services that can be used for CRUD operations, branching, and tagging of the model repository.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/EMS-Webapp">View Editor</a></h4>
        <p>VE is designed to enable users to interact with SysML models within a web-based environment. It implements
          the MMS REST API to provide a web environment to create, read, and update model elements, including Documents
          and Views.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/TMT-SysML-Model">Thirty Meter Telescope SysML Model</a></h4>
        <p>TMT is currently being developed by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmt.org/">TMT Observatory
            Corporation</a>. The TMT SysML model provides an industrial scale application of OpenMBEE and system-level
          behavior simulation. The main objective for the TMT related analysis is to provide state-dependent power
          roll-ups for different operational scenarios and demonstrate that requirements are satisfied by the design as
          well as mass roll-ups and duration analysis of the operational use cases. The model is built with an approach
          to model-based systems analysis with SysML that is both rigorous and automated. The approach’s rigor is
          established with a modeling method that is an extension of <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.incose.org/">INCOSE</a>’s Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM).</p>
