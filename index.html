          <p>Model Development Kits (MDKs) are tool-specific integrations that's
            primary purposes are to sync models with the MMS and implement the DocGen language, which allows
            modelers to dynamically generate documents in a model-based approach using the view and viewpoint concept.

          <h4><a href="projects.html#mms">Model Management System</a></h4>
          <p>MMS is a version control system for structured data. It exposes model information through RESTful web
            services that can be used for CRUD operations, branching, and tagging of the model repository.</p>

          <p>VE enables users to interact with SysML models within a web-based environment. It implements
            the MMS REST API to provide a web environment to create, read, and update model elements, including Documents
            and Views.</p>

          <h4><a href="projects.html">Thirty Meter Telescope SysML Model</a></h4>
          <p>TMT is currently being developed by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmt.org/">TMT Observatory
              Corporation</a>. The TMT SysML model provides an industrial scale application of OpenMBEE and system-level
            behavior simulation. The main objective for the TMT related analysis is to provide state-dependent power
            roll-ups for different operational scenarios and demonstrate that requirements are satisfied by the design as
            well as mass roll-ups and duration analysis of the operational use cases. The model is built with an approach
            to model-based systems analysis with SysML that is both rigorous and automated. The approach’s rigor is
            established with a modeling method that is an extension of <a target="_blank"
              href="http://www.incose.org/">INCOSE</a>’s Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM).</p>
