#### [View Editor](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/ve){:target="_blank"}

VE is designed to enable users to interact with models within a web-based environment. It interacts with the MMS REST API to provide a web environment to create, read, and update model elements, including Documents and Views. VE works in conjunction with the various Model Development Kits so data in different modeling tools can be shown in a primarily narrative format on the web without losing the connection to the data sources.

#### [Jupyter Modeling Client](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/jupyter-mdk){:target="_blank"}

The Jupyter Modeling Client for MMS will allow a dramatic expansion of the capabilities of interactive View creation, by allowing seamless integration with the MMS along with leveraging collaborative Jupyter sessions.

It's the vision that by utilising MMS's element based storage and versioning scheme with Jupyter notebooks, and Python REST client libraries that can be used within a notebook, they can provide a more interactive and powerful way to construct Views while keeping the narrative oriented presentation of View Editor.


#### [Platform for Model Analysis](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/pma){:target="_blank"}

The Platform for Model Analysis (PMA) serves as a way to automate various forms of analyses. Current feature is automated regenerating document view instances that are created in MagicDraw.


#### [COMODO](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/Comodo){:target="_blank"}

COMODO is a model transformation toolkit based on Xpand/Xtend that takes as input a UML model and transforms it into different artifacts depending on the selected target platform.

The toolkit has been developed by the European Southern Observatory ([ESO](https://www.eso.org){:target="_blank"}) to build Telescope and Instrument control and supervisor applications for different software platforms.
