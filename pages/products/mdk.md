#### Model Development Kits

OpenMBEE Model Development Kits (MDKs) are an integration concept for third party modeling tools. The engineering domain has many apps and services for modeling and analysis. The MDK architecture provides a means to integrate with modeling and analysis tools uniting the best of both worlds.

#### [Jupyter Model Development Kit](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/jupyter-mdk){:target="_blank"}

The [Jupyter MDK](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/jupyter-mdk) will allow a dramatic expansion of the capabilities of interactive View creation, by allowing seamless integration with the MMS along with leveraging collaborative Jupyter sessions.

It's the vision that by utilising MMS's element based storage and versioning scheme with Jupyter notebooks, and Python REST client libraries that can be used within a notebook, they can provide a more interactive and powerful way to construct Views while keeping the narrative oriented presentation of View Editor.

#### [Cameo Model Development Kit](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk){:target="_blank"}

The [Cameo MDK](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk){:target="_blank"} is a plugin for [Cameo Systems Modeler](https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler){:target="_blank"} that's primary purposes are to sync models with the MMS and implement the [DocGen](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mdk/tree/support/3.x/src/main/dist/manual){:target="_blank"} language, which allows modelers to dynamically generate documents in a model-based approach using the view and viewpoint concept.
