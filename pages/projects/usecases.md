          <p>TMT is currently being developed by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmt.org/">TMT Observatory
              Corporation</a>. The TMT SysML model provides an industrial scale application of OpenMBEE and system-level
            behavior simulation. The main objective for the TMT related analysis is to provide state-dependent power
            roll-ups for different operational scenarios and demonstrate that requirements are satisfied by the design as
            well as mass roll-ups and duration analysis of the operational use cases. The model is built with an approach
            to model-based systems analysis with SysML that is both rigorous and automated. The approach’s rigor is
            established with a modeling method that is an extension of <a target="_blank"
