## [Comodo](https://github.com/Open-MBEE/Comodo){:target="_blank"}

Comodo is a model-to-text transformation toolkit based on Xpand/Xtend that takes as input a UML model and transforms it into different text artifacts depending on the selected target platform. Comodo is not tool-dependant (takes UML as input), and can be enhanced into generating any kind of text artifact by writing up new templates.

The toolkit has been developed by the European Southern Observatory ([ESO](https://www.eso.org){:target="_blank"}) to build Telescope and Instrument control and supervisor applications for different software platforms.
