        <p>OpenMBEE, the First International Workshop on Open Model Based Engineering Environment is organized as part of the IEEE/ACM 23nd International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (<a href="http://www.modelsconference.org/">MODELS 2020</a>) in Montreal, Canada.</p>
        <p>OpenMBEE will take place on <strong>TBD</strong> aiming at defining the future directions of this area by bringing together world experts for an intense half-day workshop.</p>
        <p>
          The Open Model Based Engineering Environment (OpenMBEE) group is a community of engineering practitioners, software developers, 
          and researchers that share a common vision for a world where engineering modeling relies on a rich open source set of models and 
          software that support engineering modeling and analysis in the form of an integrated environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This environment shall enable 
          collaborative modeling at scale and be an open platform for (system) engineering tools. It is also expected to support conventions 
          and practices that will support cultivating a culture of collaborative engineering model development to transform the currently 
          often siloed engineering practice. 
          </p><p>
          Using software development as a guide, we expect engineering modeling will leverage many of 
          those capabilities and practices with addi-tional novelty germane to the world of engineering modeling and analysis. As in most 
          organizations documents are the primary publishing mechanism for engineering work based on models, the environment is expected to 
          enable mutually consistent and corresponding engineering models and documents achieving the single source of authority. 
          </p><p>
          The OpenMBEE community strives to develop capabilities that help organi-zations better define and manage their MBX (Model Based X) 
          ecosystems. MBX ecosystems consist of the models, tools, processes, and people/roles that come to-gether to develop the 
          systems/products that an organization cares about. The MBEE capabilities and tooling scope for this workshop is not restricted 
          to the currently available items, although it is encouraged to leverage them. 
          </p><p>
          The goal is to contribute processes, code, apps, 
          services and artifacts that are accessible by OpenMBEE users as well as vendors and partners, and allow them to collaboratively 
          construct and analyze the precision products needed to develop missions and systems.  
          </p><p>
          In the OpenMBEE context, SysMLv2 is emerging 
          into the multi-language paradigm togeth-er with Project Jupyter as a popular polyglot engineering platform for analytical and 
          computational models. 
          </p><p>
          Similarly, in the Jupyter and Python space there is a desire to see broader modeling capabilities in these 
          general purpose languages. They are envisaged to play a major role in the near future as key enabling technologies for MBx ecosystems.

          OpenMBEE is a half-day workshop held as part of  <a href="http://www.modelsconference.org/">MODELS 2020</a>. 
          The OpenMBEE Workshop aims to share
          <ol>
            <li> experiences of developing and operating Model-Based Engineering Environ-ments (MBEEs)</li>
<li> how new and existing technologies support MBEEs</li>
<li> how SysMLv2 emerging into the multi-language paradigm and API standard drives MBEEs</li>

<li> Human-Centered Design approaches to improve usability and effectiveness of MBEEs</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p>
A primary objective is to bring together research, vendors, and practitioners where practitioners provide requirements, 
        needs and pain points, researchers investigate those, and vendors commercialize viable solutions.</p>
<p>
          The workshop will be highly interactive to 
        achieve this goal. A significant portion of the workshop’s time is reserved for focused discussions. 
  
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming a sufficient number of high-quality submissions are received, OpenMBEE’20 is envisioned to be a workshop consisting of:
          <ul>
<li>One keynote</li>
<li>One invited presentations on topics related to the workshop by suitable speakers from academia or industry.</li>
            <li>“lightning talks” on a topic related to OpenMBEE that will jump-start the discussions</li>
        </ul>

The workshop defines an MBEE as a system development environment which facilitates a formalized application of (systems) 
engineering by leveraging models where engineers can develop their system models for qualification and certification across 
a portfolio of engineering tools in multiple paradigms. Tools forming the MBEE can come from industry or academia and be freely 
available, open source, or commercial.
