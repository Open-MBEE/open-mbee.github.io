      <h4>Models and Cookbooks</h4>
      <p>Open MBEE has several open source modeling projects built within the Open MBEE Software</p>
      <br>
      <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://mms.openmbee.org/alfresco/mmsapp/mms.html#/projects/PROJECT-d94630c2-576c-4edd-a8cd-ae3ecd25d16c/master">Thirty Meter Telescope SysML Model</a></h4>
      <p>TMT is currently being developed by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tmt.org/">TMT Observatory
        Corporation</a>. The TMT SysML model provides an industrial scale application of OpenMBEE and system-level
        behavior simulation. The main objective for the TMT related analysis is to provide state-dependent power
        roll-ups for different operational scenarios and demonstrate that requirements are satisfied by the design as
        well as mass roll-ups and duration analysis of the operational use cases. The model is built with an approach
        to model-based systems analysis with SysML that is both rigorous and automated. The approach’s rigor is
        established with a modeling method that is an extension of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.incose.org/">INCOSE</a>’s
        Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM).</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Cookbooks</h4>
      <p>
        Engineering cookbooks are a compendium for the engineer which captures best practices, lessons learned, and provides
        guidance on how to use languages and tools to achieve a certain engineering task, such as “How-to Verify Requirements”.
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://mms.openmbee.org/alfresco/mmsapp/mms.html#/projects/PROJECT-ID_2_2_17_7_33_25_AM_3ccfaf88_159fe0d7ba9__7d4e_cae_tw_jpl_nasa_gov_127_0_0_1/master/document/_18_5_2_e64033a_1513276256458_934885_22190">OpenSE Cookbook</a>
        is such a reference that is an open-sourced collection of patterns, procedures, and best practices
        targeted for systems engineers who seek guidance on applying model-based and executable systems engineering using SysML [7].
        Its content has emerged from the system level modeling effort on the European Framework Program 6 (FP6) and the
        Thirty Meter Telescope. </p><p>
        Application of the OpenSE Cookbook practices enables consistent delivery of engineered products using a well-defined modeling
        approach called the Executable Systems Engineering Method (<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/TMT-SysML-Model/blob/master/Presentations/SPIE_2016_Creating_Systems_Engineering_Products_With_Executable_Models_In_A_Model-Based_Engineering_Environment.docx">ESEM</a>),
        which is a refinement of the Object Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM). </p><p>
        ESEM introduces the next phase of system modeling emphasizing executable models to enhance
        understanding, precision, and verification of requirements. </p><p>
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/TMT-SysML-Model/blob/master/Presentations/OpenSE-Cookbook-Paper-SPIE-2018.pdf">OpenSE Cookbook</a> provides a consistent, comprehensive, detailed, and background-agnostic set of operational procedures to
        guide practitioners through MBSE. Unlike existing SysML literature whose goal is to provide the foundations of descriptive
        modeling to newcomers and bring forward the arguments in favor of MBSE, the OpenSE Cookbook represents an implementation of
        what such literature often refers to as best practices or organization-specific procedures. It provides goal oriented guidance
        for systems engineers explained by a set of combinable patterns. Systems engineering workflows drive each of the pattern
        definitions, such as how to verify requirements, roll-up technical resources, and analysis.</p><p>
        The OpenSE Cookbook demonstrates how to build and analyze system models using OpenMBEE as applied to educational examples as well as actual usages in the
        TMT production model.</p><p>
        The overall goal of the OpenSE Cookbook in conjunction with OpenMBEE is to commoditize the Executable Systems Engineering Method,
        i.e. remove the cost and barriers to entry that allows for expanded innovation and broader operations driven by increased user
        access and decreased costs, in order to foster the broadest adoption.</p><p>
        The orginal version of the cookbook can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://mbse.gfse.de/documents/faq.html">here</a>. It was
        created by the <a target="_blank" href="http://omgwiki.org/MBSE/doku.php?id=mbse:telescope">INCOSE Telescope Modeling Challenge Team</a>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Model Libraries</h4>
      <p>
       The OpenSE Cookbook is accompanied by the <a target="_blank" href="https://mms.openmbee.org/alfresco/mmsapp/mms.html#/projects/PROJECT-6e50f60a-ee13-4ee7-bd3a-e39338890c2d/master/document/_18_0_6_bec02f9_1498838354230_843679_41313">OpenSE model library</a>
       that provides model templates (e.g. to support ESEM), structural elements (e.g. for organizational charts), and behavioral elements to facilitate the authoring and
       analysis of models following the described patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/Comodo">COMODO></a> is a model transformation toolkit based on
        Xpand/Xtend that takes as input a UML model and transforms it into
        different artifacts depending on the selected target platform.</p><p>
        The toolkit has been developed by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) to build Telescope and Instrument control
        and supervisor applications for different software platforms.</p><p>
        It is accompanied by a library of platform independent
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/Comodo/tree/master/Models/Devices">re-usable behavioral models</a>

      <h4>Model Management System (MMS) and the Platform for Model Analysis (PMA)</h4>
      <p> The MMS and PMA provide services for managing models and executing analysis behind connected document models.</p>
      <br>
      <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/mms">Model Management System</a></h4>
      <p>MMS is a version control system for structured data. It exposes model information through RESTful web
        services that can be used for CRUD operations, branching, and tagging of the model repository.
        This heart of the MMS is the View Service which supports the transclusion features of Views. The MMS also
        provides web services for storing and searching Jupyter Lab notebooks.

      <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/ve">Jupyter and View Editor</a></h4>
      <p>VE is designed to enable users to interact with models within a web-based environment. It interacts with
        the MMS REST API to provide a web environment to create, read, and update model elements, including Documents
        and Views. VE works in conjunction with the various Model Development Kits so data in different modeling tools
        can be shown in a primarily narrative format on the web without losing the connection to the data sources.

      <h4><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/jupyter-mdk">Jupyter Modeling Client</a></h4>
      <p>The Jupyter Modeling Client for MMS will allow a dramatic expansion of the capabilities of interactive View creation, by
        allowing seamless integration with the MMS along with leveraging collaborative Jupyter sessions.
      </p>
      <p>Note this client is in POC phase with initial code <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Open-MBEE/jupyter-mdk">here</a></p>
      <p>It's the vision that by utilising MMS's element based storage and versioning scheme with Jupyter notebooks, and Python REST client
          libraries that can be used within a notebook, they can provide a more interactive and powerful way to construct Views while keeping the
          narrative oriented presentation of View Editor.
