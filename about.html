    OpenMBEE is an open source community built around a Model-Based Engineering Environment.
    The concept is to create an integrated environment for engineering that is driven around models and capabilities
    which support model-based approaches. Such environments inherently serve multiple modeling languages as well as
    a
    variety of techniques for model checking, simulation, document generation etc.
    OpenMBEE GitHub has a variety of open source projects supporting this pursuit as well as contributed open source
    models.
    The intent is that more open source models and model libraries will flourish as the community grows.
    Another distinctive quality is that the open source software on OpenMBEE includes plugins or extensions for
    commercial tools. This supports the idea to create a unified environment based on a variety of commodity
    software.
    Software is typically licensed under Apache 2. So it is free to use without strings.
    OpenMBEE has several major organizations on the leadership team. Anyone is welcome to join.
    There are regular meetings on line and face to face. We hold regular face to face meetings at the OMG and we
    meet regularly online.

    OpenMBEE software provides a platform for modeling that utilizes the Model Management System (MMS) that can be
    accessed
    from rich SysML desktop clients like MagicDraw, light-weight web-based client like View Editor, mathematical
    computation
    programs like Mathematica, and any other tool that can utilize RESTful web services. It provides infrastructure
    for
    versioning, workflow management, and access control. OpenMBEE software facilitates multi-tool and
    multi-repository integration across
    engineering, computing, and management disciplines. OpenMBEE software provides the core allowing tracking
    relations between
    heterogeneous data sources in a linked data architecture. System models are constructed, queried and rendered
    following the view and viewpoint paradigm.
